.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libdivecomputer/irda.h
.Ft dc_status_t
.Fo dc_irda_open
.Fa "dc_iostream_t **iostream"
.Fa "dc_context_t *context"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
Opens an iostream for a IrDA (Infra Red) device.
Accepts a
.Fa context
opened with
.Xr dc_context_new 3 ,
.Fa address
given through
.Xr dc_irda_iterator_new 3
together with
.Xr dc_irda_device_get_address 3
, the last argument 
.Fa lsad 
is a port number used during the communication. Currently only Uwatec computers use IrDA comminication and for those the
.Fa lsad
can be hardcoded to 1
.Pp
Upon returning
.Dv DC_STATUS_SUCCESS ,
the
.Fa iostream
pointer must be freed with
.Xr dc_iostream_free 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Returns
